# nixos-config

This repository contains my personal NixOS configurations for desktops, laptops, and servers. The setup is modular and declarative, aiming to make my systems reproducible and easy to manage.

⚠️ This project is a work in progress and evolves as my needs change.

## Features

- Modular structure for easy customization
- Covers both personal devices and homelab servers
- Uses [Nix flakes](https://nixos.wiki/wiki/Flakes) and [home-manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/)
